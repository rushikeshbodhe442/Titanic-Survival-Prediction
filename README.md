# Titanic Survival Prediction
I started with the data exploration where I got a feeling for the dataset,
checked about missing data and learned which features are important. 
During this process I used seaborn and matplotlib to do the visualizations. 
During the data preprocessing part, I computed missing values, converted features into numeric ones, grouped values into categories and created a few new features. 
Afterwards I started training  different machine learning models, 
picked one of them (random forest) and applied cross validation on it.
